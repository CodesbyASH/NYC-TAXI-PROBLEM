# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction ðŸš–ðŸ“Š

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to predict the duration of taxi trips in New York City using historical ride data. Leveraging Python and machine learning, the project goes through a full data science pipeline â€” from raw data cleaning to model deployment insights.

---

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost


---

 ðŸ—ƒ Dataset
- **Source**: [NYC Taxi Trip Duration | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration)
- Includes ~145k ride entries with pickup/dropoff datetime, coordinates, trip duration, vendor IDs, etc.

ðŸ“Š Key Steps

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Distribution of trip duration
- Peak taxi demand hours
- Vendor-wise passenger patterns
- Trip duration variation across days and time slots

 2. Feature Engineering

- `trip_distance` using Haversine formula
- `avg_speed_kmh`
- Rush hour and weekend flags
- Passenger Ã— distance interaction term
- Log-transformed `trip_duration` to handle skewness

 
 3. Outlier Detection

- IQR method
- Log normalization to improve variance stability

 4. Modeling

-  Algorithm used: **XGBoost Regressor**
- Tuned via GridSearchCV

- Evaluation metrics:
  - ðŸ“‰ **MAE**: ~48 seconds
  - ðŸ§  **RÂ² Score**: 0.966

- Visual validation with actual vs predicted comparison

 ðŸ“ˆ Findings

- Longer trips naturally align with longer durations (strong distance-duration correlation)
- Weekday trips show more predictable behavior due to structured travel patterns
- Vendor 2 had a higher average passenger count per trip
